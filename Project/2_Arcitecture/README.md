# Sensor:
  * Ultrasonic sensor:
    * The traditional security systems based on opening of doors and windows. Our ultrasonic sensor technology is used, it detects the intruders on their physical presence. An ultrasonic sensor can measure the distance to an obstacle within its conic beam. The sensor has multiple modes of operation such as serial passive control mode which always waits for command to initiate a measurement, autonomous trigger mode which makes measures every 25msec, and PWM passive control mode which outputs the measurement in an analog PWM format.
    
# Servo Motor:
A servomotor (or servo motor) is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.

# Potentiometer:
The measuring instrument called a potentiometer is essentially a voltage divider used for measuring electric potential (voltage). The component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name. Potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers. Potentiometers work by varying the position of a sliding contact across a uniform resistance. In a potentiometer, the entire input voltage is applied across the whole length of the resistor.

# Arduino:
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button.  The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. 

# Working Principle:
  * An ultrasonic sensor is tied to a servo motor. 
  * The servo motor rotates continuously between 0 and 180 degrees, performing the function of a radar.
  * When an object comes in the range of the sensor, the sensor tracks it and raises an alarm. 
  * The corresponding distance of the object from the sensor gets displayed on the LCD screen.
