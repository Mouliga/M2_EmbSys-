# WIRELESS DOORBELL USING ARDUINO

# Requirements:
Traditional Doorbells are wired devices and are usually fixed at one place. They are becoming obsolete because of these reasons and are gradually being replace by advanced Wireless Doorbell Devices. With a wireless doorbell, the position of the switch and the bell is not fixed.
We can place it anywhere we want and also the installation is pretty simple. The setup of wireless doorbell doesnâ€™t require any internal wiring. Also, if the wired doorbell is not fixed while construction, we need to make holes for wiring and installation.
