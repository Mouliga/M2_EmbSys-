# SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM:

# Introduction:
Smart Irrigation system is useful for watering the plants as it calculates the amount of moisture present in the soil.This way you can keep soil moisture to a set point.This system automatically waters the plants when we are on vacation. As we are setting the soil moisture level, we need not worry about too much of watering and the plants end up dying anyway.
# Advantages:
  1. Smart irrigation systems can optimize water levels based on things such as soil moisture and weather predictions.
  2. Long Term Enhanced Landscape Health.
  3. Project The Communityâ€™s Water Supply For Generations.

# Disadvantages:
  * Smart watering system is a bit expensive.
  * Depending on the size of your property, you will need more systems. Of course saving on water bills will lead to less cost. If you want to use this system for lawn watering, it's better to fix it under the ground before planting.

# Components:
  * Arduino
  * Servo motor
  * Soil moisture sensor
  * Mini water pump
  * Relay module
  * Connecting Jumpers		
  * Breadboard
