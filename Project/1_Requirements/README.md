# SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM:

# Introduction:
Automatic Irrigation system monitors the soil moisture and depending on set points turns on/off the pump which is connected to the relay. This way you can keep soil moisture to a set point.This system automatically waters the plants when we are on vacation. As we are setting the soil moisture level, we need not worry about too much of watering and the plants end up dying anyway.The project is designed to develop an automatic irrigation system which switches the pump motor ON/OFF on sensing the moisture content of the soil.

# Advantages:
  1. Smart irrigation systems can optimize water levels based on things such as soil moisture and weather predictions.
  2. Long Term Enhanced Landscape Health.
  3. Project The Communityâ€™s Water Supply For Generations.

# Disadvantages:
  * Smart watering system is a bit expensive.
  * Depending on the size of your property, you will need more systems. Of course saving on water bills will lead to less cost. If you want to use this system for lawn watering, it's better to fix it under the ground before planting.
